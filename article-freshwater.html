    <p class="mb-4">Freshwater is one of the most precious resources on our planet, yet it is also one of the most threatened. Only about 3% of the Earth's water is freshwater, and less than 1% is easily accessible for human use. This small fraction must meet the needs of billions of people, as well as countless plants and animals that depend on freshwater ecosystems. Rivers, lakes, and underground aquifers are vital for drinking water, agriculture, sanitation, and industry.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">The demand for freshwater is rising due to population growth, agriculture, and industry. At the same time, pollution from chemicals, plastics, and untreated waste is contaminating rivers, lakes, and groundwater. Climate change is making the situation worse by causing droughts, reducing snowpack, and altering rainfall patterns. In many regions, over-extraction of water for irrigation and industry is causing rivers to dry up and groundwater levels to fall.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Conserving freshwater is essential for health, food security, and the environment. Simple actions like fixing leaks, using water-efficient appliances, and taking shorter showers can save thousands of liters of water each year. Communities can protect water sources by planting trees, restoring wetlands, and reducing pollution. Farmers can adopt sustainable irrigation methods, and industries can treat wastewater before releasing it into the environment.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Governments and organizations are working to improve water management, invest in clean technologies, and educate people about the importance of water conservation. By supporting these efforts and making conscious choices in our daily lives, we can help ensure that clean, safe water is available for everyoneâ€”now and in the future. Remember, every drop counts. By valuing and protecting freshwater, we safeguard the health of people and the planet for generations to come.</p>
